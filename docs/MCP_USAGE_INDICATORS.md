## 📊 How to Verify MCP is Active

### 1. **Check Configuration Status**

**Claude Desktop:**
- Open developer tools (Ctrl+Shift+I)
- Look for MCP connections in console
- Check for "npmplus-mcp" in active servers

**Windsurf:**
```bash
# In Windsurf terminal
windsurf --list-mcp-servers
```

**Cursor:**
- Command Palette → "Developer: Show Logs"
- Look for MCP initialization messages

**VS Code + Cline:**
- View → Output → Select "Cline"
- Look for "MCP server started: npmplus-mcp"

### 2. **Test Commands**

Try these test commands to verify MCP is working:

```
// Simple test
"MCP status"
"List available MCP tools"
"@npmplus-mcp test"

// Functional test
"Search for a package called express"
"What tools does npmplus-mcp provide?"
```

### 3. **Check Response Format**

**With MCP Active:**
- Structured data with icons
- Detailed package information
- Real-time data from npm registry
- Execution time shown

**Without MCP:**
- Generic text responses
- No real package data
- AI knowledge cutoff limitations
- No execution indicators

## 🎯 MCP Usage Patterns

### Direct Invocation
```
@npmplus-mcp search packages    ✅ Definitely using MCP
@npmplus-mcp.search_packages     ✅ Definitely using MCP
```

### Natural Language (Auto-detection)
```
"Search for React packages"      ⚡ May use MCP (check indicators)
"Install express"                ⚡ May use MCP (check indicators)
"Check bundle size"              ⚡ May use MCP (check indicators)
```

### Explicit Request
```
"Use NPM Plus to search"         ✅ Will use MCP if available
"With npmplus-mcp, check..."     ✅ Will use MCP if available
```

## 🚨 When MCP is NOT Being Used

**You'll see:**
- Generic responses without real data
- "I would help you..." instead of actual results
- No tool usage indicators
- Knowledge cutoff limitations mentioned
- Suggestions to run npm commands manually

**Example without MCP:**
```
You: Search for React testing libraries

AI: To search for React testing libraries, you can use npm search:
`npm search react testing`

Some popular React testing libraries include:
- @testing-library/react (based on my knowledge)
- enzyme (note: may be outdated)
- react-test-renderer

For current information, please check npm directly.
```

## 📈 MCP Activity Monitoring

### Analytics Dashboard
If analytics are enabled, you can see:
- Tool usage frequency
- Success/failure rates
- Response times
- Most used tools

### Log Files
Check these locations:
- **Claude**: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
- **Windsurf**: `.windsurf/logs/`
- **Cursor**: `.cursor/logs/`
- **VS Code**: `.vscode/logs/`

Look for entries like:
```
[MCP] Tool invoked: search_packages
[MCP] Server: npmplus-mcp
[MCP] Duration: 523ms
[MCP] Status: success
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting No MCP Usage

If MCP isn't being used when expected:

1. **Verify Configuration**
   ```json
   // Should see npmplus-mcp in config
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "npmplus-mcp": { ... }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Restart Editor**
   - Configuration changes require restart
   - Check for initialization errors

3. **Test Explicitly**
   ```
   @npmplus-mcp test connection
   @npmplus-mcp list tools
   ```

4. **Check Permissions**
   - Firewall blocking for hosted service
   - NPX permissions for local install

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Be Explicit** when you want MCP:
   - "Use NPM Plus to..."
   - "@npmplus-mcp ..."
   - "With the MCP tool..."

2. **Watch for Indicators**:
   - Tool usage messages
   - Structured output
   - Real-time data

3. **Verify Important Operations**:
   - Security audits
   - Package installations
   - Bundle size checks

Always look for the visual indicators and structured output to confirm MCP is being used!
